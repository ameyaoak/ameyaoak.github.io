IAM

C=Confidentialiy using password/MFA
I=Integrety using encrypt/decrypt
A=Avalibility using failure preotection/rollback

In Aws not to use root user but create admin user for org

Users in IAM
1.Root User
2.IAM User = users created by root user
3.Federated existing users = federated users of LDAP/AD

Root user must create Admin user (access to all but not billing console)
Admin users must create child users
Admin will create groups = for assigning multiple users with same access like multiple admins

Roles are for application as you cannot assign permissions to applications
like app on ec2 to access s3 bucket data
So we need to create a role and assign it to app that needs the service
